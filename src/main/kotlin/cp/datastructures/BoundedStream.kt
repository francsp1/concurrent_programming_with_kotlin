/**
 * Develop the BoundedStream<T> class implementing a thread-safe bounded multi-producer multi-consumer
 * sequence of items, where each item is associated to a monotonically increasing index,
 * starting at index zero.
 *
 * Each instance is constructed with a capacity. Producers write items of type T into the end of the
 * stream. If the stream is already at full capacity, then the oldest item (i.e. the item with the lowest index)
 * is discarded. Indexes are not reused, i.e., no two written items can have the same index.
 *
 * Consumers read items starting at a given index: if this index is lower or equal that the streamâ€™s
 * highest index, then the read request is completed immediately; otherwise the read will block until
 * the stream has elements with index greater or equal to the requested one. The read operation does
 * not remove the items of the stream. Each consumer is responsible for maintaining its own reading
 * index independently of the BoundedStream<T> instance.
 *
 * The stream should also support a close operation, after which all read or write operations should
 * terminate immediately with an indication of the stream closed state.
 *
 * The blocking operations, namely the read function, must support cancellation via timeout and must
 * also implement the JVM interruption protocol.
