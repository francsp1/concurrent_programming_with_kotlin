/**
 * Class whose instances represent <i>unbounded queues</i>.
 *
 * An <i>unbounded queue</i> is a synchronization object used to support communication
 * between threads that produce items to be used (consumed) by other threads. The former are
 * named <i>producers</i>, the latter are named <i>consumers</i>.
 *
 * This type of synchronization object is useful when the expected production rate is lower than
 * the rate of consumption. In such scenario, memory exhaustion provoked by the absence of bounds
 * does not occur.
 *
 * Notice that this implementation has a FIFO policy for servicing contending threads.
 *
 * Implementation note: the implementation does not optimize the number of context switches.
